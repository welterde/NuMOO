Changes in version 0.2.1-5.0.0:

- The C standard permits an enumeration to have tags with duplicate
  value (ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (E) 6.7.2.2.3), so when there are both long
  and short forms of the same name, include both in the header file.

Changes in version 0.2-5.0.0:

- Updated UCD to version 5.0.0 from the Unicode Consortium.
- Added appropriate new enumeration.
- Fixed a few minor compilation bugs.
- Include the UCD version number in the library number.
